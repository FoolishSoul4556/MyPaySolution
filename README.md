Cert.4 in Programming One Project

This file includes my project I did in TAFE NSW at Petersham when I was studying the Certificate 4 in Programming course. I am solely using this project as as reference for job applications showing my prevsious work have done. 
The project is done using C# and the library, 'CsvHelper' which I found from NuGet packages. I have used this library as my project assessment required me to transfer .csv file into the program and then do some calculation with data I had received from the file. 


My program works by having a '.csv' file imported (as mentioned before) then using the CsvHelper library and using the namespace 'using System.Collections.Generic, I was able to use the dictionary and list<> collection values to assign the coloumns and rows to its own catergory. After doing this, the data get send to its separate required classes where it later transfers to another class to get calculation necessary to proceed. Soon after the calculations are made, the data goes back to its original classes which both sends to another class used to write (export) the new created data. The final stage is too export the data into another folder and show the new data in Console. 


CsvHelper .NET library is the creation of Josh Close, here's to getting started with CsvHelper: https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/ 
By using the IDE Visual Studio 2019, I was able to achieve the ease of coding this project program.
